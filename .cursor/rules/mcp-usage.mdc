# MCP Usage Rules

## Required MCP Tools

- `context7`: package/version/option/spec/compatibility verification
- `sequential-thinking`: all analysis/judgment/planning tasks
- `firebat`: project codebase analysis

Usage of reasoning, assumptions, simulation, memory, or experience to substitute MCP is forbidden.

## Decision Tree

### context7 — MUST use when ANY of these apply:

1. Runtime choice (Bun vs Node API, `import.meta.*`, `Bun.file`, `Bun.spawn`, etc.)
2. Package add/remove/version change, API usage, compatibility
3. Public API change (CLI flags, MCP tool interface, `package.json` exports)
4. Config file change (`.rc`, `config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, oxlint, knip, drizzle-kit)
5. Version/compatibility judgment (tool version differences, Node/Bun version requirements)

**Procedure**: context7 call FIRST → present result to user → proceed only with context7 evidence.

### MCP Bypass Prohibition

- ❌ "From my memory..." / "Generally..." / "Based on docs..." / "In my experience..."
- ❌ Presenting doc links without calling context7
- ✅ Call context7 → present result → use as evidence

### sequential-thinking — MUST use when:

- Any analysis, judgment, or planning task (use as the FIRST tool call)
- Exception: simple single-file reads or trivial lookups

### firebat — Tool Selection Matrix:

| Situation | Tool(s) |
|-----------|---------|
| After code change | `scan` (mandatory) |
| Find symbol | `index_symbols` → `search_symbol_from_index` |
| Refactoring | `find_references` → `rename_symbol` |
| Code pattern search | `find_pattern` (ast-grep syntax) |
| Type/signature check | `get_hover` |
| External library API | `index_external_libraries` → `search_external_library_symbols` |

### On MCP failure:

1. STOP immediately
2. Tell the user: "MCP tool name + what information was needed"
3. Wait for the user to provide MCP results
4. NEVER substitute with reasoning/assumptions
